## Notes

This repository serves as a non-commercial project to practice data scraping skills (though sometimes the data ends up [getting](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/20/us/red-lobster-locations-closed-open-dg) [published](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/15/business/family-dollar-closure-city-leaders-reactions/index.html)). The scrapers get location data from the store lookup directories found on each company’s website. While the findings are consistent with public estimates and company disclosures about inventory levels, they likely aren't complete, as locations open and close and some may have been unintentionally missed in the scraping process.

*Please [let me know](mailto:mattstiles@gmail.com) if you have questions or concerns — or if there's a company you'd like to see on this list.*

---

## Use this code

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.10
- [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install)

We recommend using a virtual environment for Python projects. For this repo, [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is the chosen manager.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to prepare your environment:

#### 1. **Clone the repo**

First, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate into it using your terminal:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

#### 2. **Create a virtual environment**
Inside the repository directory, initiate a virtual environment using pipenv:

```
pipenv shell
```

This command creates a virtual environment and activates it.

#### 3. Install dependencies

Install the required dependencies, including [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) and others, with the following command:

```
pipenv install
```

### Launching Jupyter Lab

With your environment set up and dependencies installed, you are ready to start working with the notebooks:


```
jupyter lab
```

This command launches Jupyter Lab in your browser, where you can open, edit and run the notebooks.

### Scrape away!

Please be mindful of each company's service terms and also polite to its servers.
